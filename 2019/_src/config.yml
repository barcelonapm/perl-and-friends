     En poco más de media horita cogeremos una aplicación, construiremos su imagen docker, la subiremos a un repositorio y la desplegaremos (si pasa los tests) en staging. Tras una aprobación manual haremos lo propio en el entorno de producción. Y todo en Azure App Service con Azure DevOps. Si ésto no te da morbo, yo ya no sé.

     Git can be daunting, but we believe it's actually quite simple. The aim of this talk is to explore the simple data structures that git has had since its inception (actually since its first git commit!) and how they set the ground for the rich behaviour we are used to. But don't think this is an academic talk, it is not. It is more like a visual guide and command line experiment that we will perform together. All spiced with a little bit of genetics, but we promise you that not a single sheep will be damaged during the talk.

   description: >
     It's been around for a while, but recently I had difficulties answering the question of “What is Node.js?”. In this talk, I'll try to explain what is Node and why is not only relevant, but quite fun. Asynchronous programming is key to understand the JavaScript hegemony, so we'll spend some time explaining the event loop. Other relevant topics will be V8, npm, async/await or transpilation.

     At Cycloid, Infrastructure As Code is in the company DNA since the beginning. To help our new customers adopting this best practice, we decided to build Terracognita to convert an existing infrastructure on AWS into Terraform code in an automated way, relying on Terraform providers built by the community. We focused on AWS for a first release, but Azure, GCP, Alibaba, Vmware and Openstack will be the next to be integrated. In order to do so, TerraCognita reads what you already have running on your existing infrastructure, and write the corresponding HCL and/or tfstate relying on the import mechanism of Terraform.

Presentaré el clúster que estoy montando con tres 4B y una 3B, los problemas a los que me he enfrentado y las soluciones que he adoptado. También habrá tiempo para Q&A y conectarse al clúster via wifi."

We want everyone to know how to put banks to work for them using an API."

   description: "So you've been a bad developer, and uploaded some questionable modules to CPAN.  The good news is: we've all been there! Ask around, and chances are most CPAN authors will have released modules they are not happy with, or are plain bad ideas. There's no shame in this!  But what now? In this age of environmental awareness, how do we do our part to clean up the river of CPAN?  I'll talk about some things you can do to reduce your Bad-Code Footprint™ and help others along the way."

   description: "My first telegram bot was an automatic solver of a simple mathematical problem that my son had to solve every day when he was at the last course of primary school. But I wanted to generate all possible solutions, thus I had to use backtracking. However, \"regular\" backtracking is easy and boring, so I decided to use a well known solution involving continuations, much more difficult and funny. All in Javascript."
