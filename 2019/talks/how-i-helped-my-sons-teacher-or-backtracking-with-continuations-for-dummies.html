    <meta property="og:description" content="My first telegram bot was an automatic solver of a simple mathematical problem that my son had to solve every day when he was at the last course of primary school. But I wanted to generate all  possible solutions, thus I had to use backtracking. However, "regular" backtracking is easy and boring, so I decided to use a well known solution involving continuations, much more difficult and funny. All in Javascript." />
