    <meta property="og:description" content="At Flanks, we allow to automate any interaction that a user has with a bank. My talk is based on how to connect your bank accounts to any application using a PSD2 API. At this talk, we will see how to view your bank accounts with a telegram bot, automate emails to your banker or have Alexa notifications when they have charged you a bill. We want everyone to know how to put banks to work for them using an API." />
