    <meta property="og:description" content="So you've been a bad developer, and uploaded some questionable modules to CPAN.  The good news is: we've all been there! Ask around, and chances are most CPAN authors will have released modules they are not happy with, or are plain bad ideas. There's no shame in this!  But what now?

I'll talk about some things you can do to reduce your Bad-Code Footprint™ and help others along the way." />
