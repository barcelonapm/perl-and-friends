    <meta property="og:description" content="Git can be daunting, but we believe it's actually quite simple. The aim of this talk is to explore the simple data structures that git has had since it's inception (actually since it's first git commit!) and how they set the ground for the rich behaviour we are used to. But don't think this is an academic talk, it is not. It is more like a visual guide and command line experiment that we will perform together. All spiced with a little bit of genetics, but we promise you that not a single sheep will be damaged during the talk.
