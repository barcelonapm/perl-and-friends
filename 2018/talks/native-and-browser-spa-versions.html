    <meta property="og:description" content="We'll talk about what we learned developing the browser and native versions of a SPA, that share 90 sth % of their code using React and ReactNative and about the advantages of using a functional language like ClojureScript combined with the re-frame framework which has an architecture similar to Redux but with great conceptual improvements such as effects and coeffects that improve testability by eliminating the need of mocking inside the SPA business logic, or reactive subscriptions which make views dumber and can also reduce the number of renderings.
