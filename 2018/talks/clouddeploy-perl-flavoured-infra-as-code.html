    <meta property="og:description" content="CloudDeploy is a 100% perl-written toolkit for managing infrastructure as Moose classes and deploying it in an automated manner to AWS (only to AWS; at least, as of now).  But it is also more than that: it provides a CLI to deploy, a CLI utility to manage images, functionality to calculate 'diffs' between versions of the same stack, etc. At CAPSiDE we have been managing infrastructure for more than 15 years. The experience we have earned along the way has been bundled into this tool that has just been open sourced and made available to our community. We use CloudDeploy daily and we heavily rely on it since the project inception in 2013.
