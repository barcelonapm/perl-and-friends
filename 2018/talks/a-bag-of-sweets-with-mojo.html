    <meta property="og:description" content="Anyone knows about Mojolicious web framework and many also knows some of the modules that comes with it, like the Mojo::UserAgent and Mojo::DOM. What not that many people know is that inside the bag, there is lots of other more general purpose modules with the same sweety interface we know and love.
