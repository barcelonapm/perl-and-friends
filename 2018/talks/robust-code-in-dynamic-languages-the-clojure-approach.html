    <meta property="og:description" content="Dynamic languages have a reputation of paying a high price for his flexibility. The absence of a type checker may make it more difficult to spot subtle bugs as the business rules or data model evolves.  To avoid such risks, one of the potential approaches we can take is to increase our test coverage. Unfortunately, creating more test cases is not a silver bullet. As any other code, tests need to be created and managed. In this talk, we will explore the clojure.spec framework, the response from the clojure community to the challenges above. Once we describe (specify) the valid shapes our data can take, the toolkit, among other things, enables us to use generative testing to manage a large number of cases along with automated data validation for everyday use.
