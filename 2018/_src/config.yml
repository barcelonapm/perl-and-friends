      A talk about Dependency Injection based on "interfaces" for Perl, with
      the use of MooseX::DIC, a library I created for this task. Along the way,
      I will present the benefits of using a Dependency Injection in your
      application.

    description: >
      We show how to build a nontrivial parser using a functional language
      such as clojure or F# or Haskell. The talk is example & test driven and
      starts with the basics: parsing a single character and growing the parser
      by layering abstraction levels on top of this simple construct. Special
      emphasis is on the fact that no need for mutable variables or state is
      needed.

    description: >
      CloudDeploy is a 100% perl-written toolkit for managing infrastructure
      as Moose classes and deploying it in an automated manner to AWS (only
      to AWS; at least, as of now).  But it is also more than that: it
      provides a CLI to deploy, a CLI utility to manage images, functionality
      to calculate 'diffs' between versions of the same stack, etc.


      At CAPSiDE we have been managing infrastructure for more than 15 years.
      The experience we have earned along the way has been bundled into this
      tool that has just been open sourced and made available to our
      community. We use CloudDeploy daily and we heavily rely on it since the
      project inception in 2013.

      Anyone knows about Mojolicious web framework and many also knows some
      of the modules that comes with it, like the Mojo::UserAgent and
      Mojo::DOM.
      What not that many people know is that inside the bag, there is lots
      of other more general purpose modules with the same sweety interface
      we know and love. In this talk I'll be exploring, thru examples, all
      the non web related modules that comes inside the Mojolicious package.

      I'm one of the makers of the OpenCage Geocoder, a geocoding API built in
      Perl. My talk will focus on the challenges and pleasures behind a SaaS
      business targeting software developers. I'll look at some of the tools
      and services we use, and the challenges of being a distributed team.

    name: 'Robust code in dynamic languages: the Clojure approach'
    slug: 'robust-code-in-dynamic-languages-the-clojure-approach'
    description: >
      Dynamic languages have a reputation of paying a high price for his
      flexibility. The absence of a type checker may make it more difficult
      to spot subtle bugs as the business rules or data model evolves.  To
      avoid such risks, one of the potential approaches we can take is to
      increase our test coverage. Unfortunately, creating more test cases is
      not a silver bullet. As any other code, tests need to be created and
      managed.


      In this talk, we will explore the clojure.spec framework, the response
      from the clojure community to the challenges above. Once we describe
      (specify) the valid shapes our data can take, the toolkit, among
      other things, enables us to use generative testing to manage a large
      number of cases along with automated data validation for everyday use.

      In this short talk we would introduce some popular and convenient
      approaches for interacting with Wikipedia and Wikidata by using Perl.


      We would learn how to query the available API and SPARQL endpoints,
      create simple bots and import data.

    description: >
      CodeYourFuture, ubicada en Gran Bretaña, es la primera y única escuela
      de programación que tiene como finalidad enseñar a los refugiados a
      programar. La mitad de los estudiantes vienen de Siria. Otros vienen de
      Uganda, Etiopía, Afganistán y otro es oficialmente reconocido como sin
      estado por el gobierno de Gran Bretaña. Ninguno puede volver a su hogar
      ni a sus vidas anteriores y aprenden a programar con el fin de encontrar
      un trabajo estable en Gran Bretaña. Esperamos que después de seis meses,
      cada estudiante tenga los suficientes conocimientos de programación para
      encontrar un trabajo como desarrollador web.

    description: >
      We'll talk about what we learned developing the browser and native
      versions of a SPA, that share 90 sth % of their code using React and
      ReactNative and about the advantages of using a functional language
      like ClojureScript combined with the re-frame framework which has an
      architecture similar to Redux but with great conceptual improvements
      such as effects and coeffects that improve testability by eliminating
      the need of mocking inside the SPA business logic, or reactive
      subscriptions which make views dumber and can also reduce the number of
      renderings.
