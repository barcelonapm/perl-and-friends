Barcelona Perl & Friends
========================

The event formerly known as _Barcelona Perl Workshop_ mutated in
2017 to what's currently a more accurate description. Even though
the _Perl Workshop_ name was used traditionally for such events,
only people inside the Perl community understood that it wasn't
actually a workshop but a smaller conference in most cases.

The [Barcelona Perl Mongers](http://barcelona.pm) have long
embraced all sorts of people from other communities in their
events, thus making the new name a more appropiate match to
their usual attendees.
